This project is an e-commerce platform with a simple interface developed using modern web technologies. I attempted to customize it to resemble the online store page design of [Duolingo](https://store.duolingo.com/) for educational purposes. Advanced features of React, React Router, as well as state management and page routing capabilities, were utilized. This platform enables users to explore products, add them to their cart, and make purchases, providing a user-friendly interface.
